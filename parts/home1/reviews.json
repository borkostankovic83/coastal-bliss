            "text": "Omg , I can\u2019t  say enough about Coastal Bliss Wellness! Vesna gives hands-down the BEST massage I have ever had in my life! She goes above and beyond and you can really tell that she is highly educated, trained, and really knows what she\u2019s doing. The effects from one massage with her stay with me for weeks.\nMilena is very knowledgeable about the skin care and the skin in general. She takes time to assess the condition and choose the most suitable treatment that you need at the moment. I suffer from dry skin and her treatments have been helping me enormously .So happy I found them.\nBonus, they are so kind and lovely and I can\u2019t recommend them enough. \u2764\ufe0f",

From the moment we walked in, the space felt calm, clean, and full of good vibes. Our massage therapists, Vesna and Ceasar, were incredible \u2014 kind, empathetic, funny, and so in tune with what we needed.\n\nVesna, who\u2019s also the owner, represents her business so beautifully. She was open-minded, patient, and professional, with such strong, healing hands that made me feel brand new. You can really feel the care and passion she puts into every detail. We left feeling relaxed, recharged, and so grateful for the experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a personalized, high-quality massage with heart \u2014 this is the place to go. Can\u2019t wait to come back! \ud83d\udc86\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc86\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u2728",
