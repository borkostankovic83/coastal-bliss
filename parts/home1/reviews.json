            "text": "Omg , I can\u2019t  say enough about Coastal Bliss Wellness! Vesna gives hands-down the BEST massage I have ever had in my life! She goes above and beyond and you can really tell that she is highly educated, trained, and really knows what she\u2019s doing. The effects from one massage with her stay with me for weeks.\nMilena is very knowledgeable about the skin care and the skin in general. She takes time to assess the condition and choose the most suitable treatment that you need at the moment. I suffer from dry skin and her treatments have been helping me enormously .So happy I found them.\nBonus, they are so kind and lovely and I can\u2019t recommend them enough. \u2764\ufe0f",

She took such a good care of my skin, gave me an amazing massage that comes with a facial, my skin looks so much brigther now, it\u2019s glowing. Can\u2019t wait to come back and have my mani & pedi with her, great selection of colors. They welcomed me with cold beverages, and the most important they provide a free PARKING for you in summer! Highly recommend",
